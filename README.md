Hi Professor,
Hello, my name is Sai Mahesh, and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at Concordia University. One of the subjects I am currently enrolled in is Applied RESTful APIs and Integration. I am excited to explore this field, as it plays a vital role in modern software development by enabling seamless communication between applications. This course not only enhances my technical skills in API development but also equips me with the knowledge to design and integrate robust and scalable solutions, aligning perfectly with my aspirations in the tech industry".
